			<p>The Nike Air Force One (AF-1) has become an icon of fashion, style, and comfort. People from every age-group adore these trainers for having distinctive shapes and versatile designs. We take a look at the history of the AF-1 and some of its most eponymous models.On its 1982 introduction to the court, Nike designer Bruce Kilgore’s creation, initially only available as a high top, was striking for its hiking-boot-inspired cues and uniquely chunky sole—it was the first Nike Air cushioning on a hoops shoe. The neutral white and grey palette was one of the only parts of the shoe that played it safe. Inevitably, bolder, team-color Forces would follow—as would a low-cut, making the Air Force 1 an even more popular choice.</p>

		<p>Nike’s initial intent was to shelve the AF1 in favor of the next style, the next technology. But the model lengthened its lifeline thanks to an extended collection of different colors, a byproduct of a “color of the month” initiative pushed by a cartel of Baltimore retailers (Charley Rudo, Downtown Locker Room, and Cinderella Shoes) making ambitious orders for special makeups. Those exclusives turned the city into a destination for Forces; footwear tourism along Interstate 95 brought the sneaker’s cult status to D.C. and New York.</p>

		<p>Phased out shortly afterwards, the AF1 returned around 1986 to select East Coast stores (with a slightly altered shape complete with more regional exclusives).Due to the increasing demand for the trainers, the retailers started releasing limited editions, which again was a huge success. Nike AF-1 got countrywide recognition.</p>

		<p>The sneaker has a history of very little marketing, outside of the original ads that featured the likes of NBA stars Moses Malone and Mychal Thompson, but it was sold by Nike strictly in inner city markets. The subsequent gentrification of urban sneaker culture gives the impression that the AF1 is a people's shoe that transcends race, gender, and class. But without its initial inner city fan base keeping it alive, the Force would most likely be little more than a shoe praised by true connoisseurs and historians but forgotten by everyone else.The Air Force 1's still use little to no marketing as its legacy has been cemented in history.</p>

		<p>For special events and occasions, Nike introduces Sneaker Gold. The exclusive, limited premium edition sells before reaching then retailers.The AF1 mid hits in the mid-90s (so too did the jewel Swoosh, seen here); in 2001, a slew of new colorways flood the international market. With the 2000’s came High-tech upper were made with proprietary materials such as Foamposite, Hyperfuse, Liquid Metal and Flyknit. In early 2000 the creation of the nikeiD led to a tremendous amount of variations as users now had the opportunity to personalize the shoes to their liking.</p>

		<p>In 2001 Nike introduced women’s sizing to Air Force Ones. To the untrained eye the shape looked the same but there were several nuances that changed the shoe to fit a women’s foot and create a design unique to women. The women’s shoe is .5 centimeters larger and the heel is slightly narrower. The women’s shoe colors are softer and create more feminine hues. Designs with flowers and other designs are added to the shoes giving them a unique touch. They also recycle old designs that were specifically for men and customize them for women.

		<p>In 2014 the shape of the Air Force was redesigned by several notable figures. In 1982, the running tech inside the basketbal shoes changed in the Air Force setting the course of basketball shoe design through history. 30 years later redesigned the shoe for women and changed the style into an iconic trend that women adopted as their own. The new design of the Air Force ones held on to the fundamentals of the 1982 designs while creating a new and lighter silhouette that gave it femine looks and features. “The original Air Force 1 Low and High are joined by the all new Air Force 1 Ultra, Ultra Mid and Nike Lunar Force 1 Sky Hi to bring the legendary silhouette to places no force has gone before. (pictured below).” Designs featuring figures such as Kyrie Irving. The trilogy of Nike + R.T. Air Force 1 Collection also began to emerge at this time creating more variation and leading to more designers taking an interest in the shoes.

		<p>In 2018 the Air Force 1 was released in a pastel version in two different models of shoes called the Pale Ivory and Shadow Shoes. This edition of the Air Force Ones is covered with a protective film when the shoe is first bought and you are asked to tear past the film for the beautiful design underneath. Direct light best highlights the pastel colors hiding underneath the protective film.

		<p>In 2020 a color changing Air Force 1 was created that was UV reactive. The shoe was designed by the original creator of the Air Force One Bruce Kilogore. He composed two different versions of the shoe but the one that went to market was a shoe with “white leather panels, a monochromatic midsole combined with a semi-transparent ice blue sole.” The shoe changes its look depending on the environment the user is in, the amount of UV rays around changes the shoe in several ways. The upper part of the shoe changes when hit with UV rays from white to multicolor, while the lower part of the shoe is more subtle and changes slower when exposed to the rays. The shoe when completely changed has the colors of yellow, blue, fuchsia, and lilac. Once the user is back inside the colors start to fade until the shoe is back in the sun under UV rays.

		<p> The Louis Vuitton x Nike Air Force 1’s were seen as iconic in the summer of 2021 where they first debuted and at the final LV runway show again. The shoes create a collaboration between 3 major brands: Louis Vuitton, Virgil Abloh, and Nike to create a one of king ringarde shoe. Its drama and flare are what sets it apart in the crowd and defines the elasticity and amiability of the fashion world. “There's co-branded text done up in Abloh's signature style, quotation marks, monogrammed canvas, succulent leather uppers, references to bootleg culture — everything anyone needs for a killer collab.” On January 19, Sotheby’s auction place would debut the shoes on its website with bids starting at $2000 and up. The shoe was fleeting as it was gone in a flurry creating the ultimate buzz and demand for the shoe while it was still around and will go down in history as a valuable collectors item.
